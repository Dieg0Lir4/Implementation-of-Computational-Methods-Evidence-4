# Implementation-of-Computational-Methods-Evidence-4

## Description:

For this evidence, I chose the problem "Trapping Rain Water." In this challenge, the goal is to determine how much rainwater can be trapped given an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map. Each element of the array corresponds to the height of a bar, and the width of each bar is assumed to be 1 unit. Visualizing this problem is crucial for understanding how rainwater can accumulate between the bars. Below is an image and example provided by LeetCode illustrating the problem:

Example:
* Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
* Output: 6
* Explanation: The configuration represented by the array can trap 6 units of rainwater.

Constraints:
* The maximum number of bars is 20,000.
* The maximum height of a bar is 100,000 units.


I chose this problem not only because it is challenging but also highly relevant. It demonstrates how different spaces in the same map can have different results and how these differences can affect other spaces. For example, the problem illustrates how varying elevations can lead to different amounts of trapped water, similar to how real world terrains affect water accumulation. Additionally, this problem has various ways of solving it, making it a great test for parallel programming and sequential programming. 

## Models:

Here are some diagrams of the problem:

The topmost row in the diagram represents the array of 100,000 elements. For simplicity, only the first few elements are shown. The diagram shows how the array elements are divided among threads and blocks. Each block (indicated by blockIdx.x) contains 32 threads (indicated by threadIdx.x). Threads within each block are responsible for processing specific elements of the array. Each thread in a block has a unique index (threadIdx.x), ranging from 0 to 31 and each block has a unique index (blockIdx.x).
For this solution you have an array of heights, and you want to compute the maximum height to the left and right of each element. This computation will be performed in parallel using CUDA.

The logic is quite simple. The array of heights is divided among multiple blocks and threads. Each thread is responsible for processing a specific element of the array. Each thread calculates its global index idx (a index in the problemâ€™s array that only that thread has)

The diagram helps visualize how the array elements are mapped to threads and blocks. Each thread processes a specific element of the array to compute the left and right maximums in parallel, to then calculate the water that can be trapped in it. By dividing the work among multiple threads and blocks we make this problem way faster,  since we don't have to wait for other spaces to finish calculating their bars and water trapped.  By this approach parallel programming does a better job in large arrays like the one with 100,000 elements in this problem.
